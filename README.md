**Problem Introduction**

The Rover Control Command Line App simulates a rover navigating a 2D grid. The rover can be commanded to turn left, turn right, or move forward in the direction it is facing. Users interact with the rover using simple commands, allowing for dynamic movement and directional changes within a defined space. This app provides a fun way to explore basic programming concepts such as enums, data classes, and user input handling in Kotlin.
